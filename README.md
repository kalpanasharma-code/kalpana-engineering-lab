# Kalpana Engineering Lab

A structured repository documenting my exploration of web engineering — 
from core HTML/CSS fundamentals to modern frameworks like React and Next.js.

This lab is focused on building scalable, maintainable and performance-oriented systems 
through hands-on implementation.

---

## Philosophy

• Build from fundamentals  
• Understand before abstracting  
• Focus on structure and clarity  
• Optimize for scalability and performance  

---

## Areas of Exploration

### 1. Core Web Foundations
- Semantic HTML
- CSS Architecture (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Systems)
- Accessibility Principles
- Performance-focused styling

### 2. JavaScript & Problem Solving
- DOM manipulation
- Algorithm implementation
- Optimization patterns
- Clean code structure

### 3. Modern Frontend Engineering
- React fundamentals
- State management patterns
- Component architecture
- Next.js basics

### 4. System-Oriented Thinking
- Authentication flows
- Secure design principles
- API integration
- Scalable structure planning

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents a focused exploration area or mini-project.

Projects are built from scratch without unnecessary abstractions to ensure deep understanding.

---

## Objective

To evolve from writing code to engineering systems.

This repository serves as a continuous record of learning, experimentation, 
and architectural thinking.
